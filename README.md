1. Installation

To run the website you must install React. You need to also install Node.js for building and running our website locally. Node Package Manager (npm) comes installed with Node.js, so you don't need to worry about installing npm seperately although it is required.

After you clone the repo into your directory, run `npm install` to install any packages the website may need. Anytime you want to run the website afterwards, run npm start.
